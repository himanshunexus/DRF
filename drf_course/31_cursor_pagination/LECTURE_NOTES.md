# Study notes — Cursor Pagination in Django REST Framework (Hindi)

## Source and scope

[Watch the original lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDmQnbBmr0w). Verified: playlist position, title,
and the public description/chapters where available. Paused frames from this video were
subsequently inspected in Brave: see [visual review and timestamps](VISUAL_REVIEW.md).
These are original topic notes, not a full transcript or an exact reproduction.
Full source metadata is recorded in [sources.json](../sources.json).

## The idea in plain language

Cursor pagination follows an opaque position marker through stable ordering. It is useful for sequential traversal of changing datasets. This example uses the immutable id for predictable progress; follow next rather than guessing cursor values.

## How this project's code works

### View, explained after the code in the source file

ListCreateAPIView already implements GET list and POST create.
RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView implements GET one, PUT, PATCH and DELETE.
queryset says where records come from; serializer_class says how they are validated/output.
The detail URL supplies pk, which is the default lookup field.
DRF handles 400 validation errors, 404 missing records, and the normal success statuses.
Use get_queryset() if results depend on the request user; a class queryset alone is shared policy.
Modern version note: concrete generic views are still supported and reduce repeated handlers.

The list view applies its pagination_class automatically. An ordinary APIView would need explicit pagination.


### Serializer, explained after the code in the source file

ModelSerializer builds fields and default create/update methods from Student.
Meta.model selects the model; fields explicitly chooses the public API fields.
id is read-only: the database assigns it; clients cannot change it through this API.
StudentSerializer(student).data converts an object to primitive Python values.
StudentSerializer(queryset, many=True).data serializes a list of objects.
For input, pass data=request.data, call is_valid(), then save().
save() creates when there is no instance; save() updates when an instance is supplied.
The renderer converts serializer.data into JSON; serializer.data itself is not JSON text.
Modern version note: use explicit fields instead of accidentally exposing future fields.


### Follow one request

The client requests a URL. [Project URLs](config/urls.py) remove `/api/` and
[app URLs](api/urls.py) choose the handler. DRF handlers perform authentication,
permissions and throttling before the body of your view. The view may read the ORM,
validate input with a serializer, save a row, and return a Response. A renderer creates
the actual JSON body. Raw Django views in lessons 6 and 9 render responses themselves.
The static introductory view returns a dictionary without querying Student.

## Version and implementation updates

- This project targets Django **5.2 LTS**, DRF **3.16**, current-style `path()` routes,
  explicit serializer fields and SQLite. Exact tested pins are in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
- This is a modern implementation choice, not a verified line-by-line comparison with the video.
- DRF views use `request.data`, `is_valid(raise_exception=True)` and meaningful 201/204/400/404 statuses.
- PUT requires required writable fields; PATCH preserves omitted fields. Never use a GET body for lookup ids.
- CSRF stays enabled. Session-authenticated unsafe requests need a valid CSRF token.
- Token and Basic authentication need HTTPS outside localhost. JWT access tokens expire;
  DRF database tokens do not expire automatically.
- Django 5.2 supports newer Python runtimes; check the selected package versions if using another runtime.
  The local run is evidence only for the interpreter listed in [validation report](../VALIDATION.md).
- Browsable API removal is presentation configuration, not a security control.

## Common mistakes

- **404 at /**: use the documented `/api/` endpoint.
- **No such table**: run migrate in this lesson folder, then seed.
- **400**: inspect the field errors; JSON must use double quotes and a unique roll.
- **401/403**: use this lesson's authentication scheme; session writes additionally need CSRF.
- **405**: the chosen URL does not support that method. Read-only lessons intentionally reject writes.
- **415**: send `Content-Type: application/json` for a JSON body.
- **429**: the throttling limit was reached; inspect Retry-After and wait.
- Changes to another lesson have no effect: each folder is an independent project and database.

## Practice

Follow the next link until it is null, and verify every seeded student appears once.

Explain the request path in your own words, then run [the tests](api/tests.py).

## Added after visual review

Read [mypaginations.py](api/mypaginations.py), request `/api/practice/pagination/`, then follow next exactly. There is no total count. id supplies a stable unique order; the lecture's intermediate error illustrates why an absent created field cannot be the order key.

See [VISUAL_REVIEW.md](VISUAL_REVIEW.md) for observed names, timestamps and deliberate differences.
